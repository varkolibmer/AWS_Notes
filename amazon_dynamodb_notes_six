DynamoDB Streams
- Ordered stream of item-level modifications (create/update/delete) in a table
- Stream records can be:
  - Sent to Kinesis Data Streams
  - Read by AWS Lambda
  - Read by Kinesis Client Library Applications
- Data retention for up to 24 hours
- Use cases:
  - React to changes in real-time (welcome email to users)
  - Analytics
  - Insert into derivative tables
  - Insert into OpenSearch Service
  - Implement cross-region replication
- Ability to choose the information that will be written to the stream
  - KEYS_ONLY: only the key attributes of the modified item
  - NEW_IMAGE: the entire item, as it appears after it was modified
  - OLD_IMAGE: the entire item, as it appeared before it was modified
  - NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES: both the new and the old images of the item
- DynamoDB Streams are made of Shards, just like Kinesis Data Streams
- You don't provision shards, this is automated by AWS
- Records are not retriactively populated in a Stream after enabling it
