DynamoDB: Local Secondary Index
- Alternative Sort Key for your table (same Partition Key as that of base table)
- The Sort Key consists of one scalar attribute (String, Number, or Binary)
- Up to 5 Local Secondary Indexes per table
- Must be defined at table creation time
- Attribute Projections: can contain some or all attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)







DynamoDB: Global Secondary Index (GSI)
- Alternative primary key (HASH or HASH+RANGE) from the base table
- Speed up queries on non-key attributes
- The Index Key consists of Scalar attributes (String, Number, or Binary
- Attribute Projections: some or all the attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)
- Must provision RCUs and WCUs for the index
- Can be added/modified after table creation






DynamoDB: Indexes and Throttling
- Global Secondary Index (GSI)
  - *If the writes are throttled on the GSI, then the main table will be throttled*
  - Even if the WCU on the main tables are fine
  - Choose your GSI partition key carefully
  - Assign your WCU capacity carefully
- Local Secondary Index (LSI)
  - Uses the WCUs and RCUs of the main table
  - No special throttling considerations
