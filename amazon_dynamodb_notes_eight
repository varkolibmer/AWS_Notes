DynamoDB: Time To Live (TTL)
- Automatically delete items after an expiry timestamp
- Doesn't consume any WCUs (no extra cost)
- The TTL attribute must be a "Number" data type with "Unix Epoch timestamp" value
- Expired items deleted within 48 hours of expiration
- Expired items, that haven't been deleted, appears in reads/queries/scans (if you don't want them, filter them out)
- Expred items are deleted from both LSIs and GSIs
- A delete operation for each expired item enters the DynamoDB streams (can help recover expired items)
- Use cases: reduce stored data by keeping only current items, adhere to regulatory obligations,...
