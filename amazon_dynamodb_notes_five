DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
- Fully-managed, highly available, seamless in-memory cache for DynamoDB
- Microseconds latency for cached reads and queries
- Doesn't require application logic modification (compatible with existing DynamoDB APIs)
- Solves the "Hot Key" problem (too many reads)
- 5 minure TTL for cache (default)
- Up to 10 nodes in the cluster
- Multi-AZ (3 nodes minimum recommended for production)
- Secure (Encryption at rest with KMS, VPC, IAM, CloudTrail, ...)
